		<h1>What Is Anime?</h1>
		<h2>Anime Definition:</h2>
		<!--&esmp is a four space tab character-->
		<p>
			&emsp;Although anime, by definition, is a simple shortening of the word "animation" that is not what comes to mind for people who know the word. When using the word, most people are typically referring to animated TV shows or movies from and made in Japan. Anime also has a certain style to it, characters with big eyes, physical appearances that would be impossible in real life and oddly colored hair. Although those different traits as well as many others may vary depending on the specific art style of any one show or film. Just like animation, anime comes in many different genres but unlike animation, there are some genres specific to anime. Here are some definitions of anime specific genres and animation genres in the context of anime.

		<h2 class="right-align-header">Shōnen:</h2>
		<p class="right-align-paragraph">
			The word "Shōnen" translates to the phrase "few years" referencing who the genre is for, young to teenage boys (age 10-18). That is who it's aimed at because the content of Shōnen anime typically consists of over the top fights between heroes and villains who progressively gain crazy amounts of power (or powers) as the series' go on. Often, these powers will be unified under a power system. Be it the real world influence of <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/qi">qi</a> or something more unrealistic like transforming swords, it's all there. Shōnen anime also all share a common factor in theme. The themes of almost every anime in the genre have something to do with friendship, fighting spirit, and perseverance with many of the series being "feel good" in nature. Of course, like anything, there are exceptions with great writers pushing the limits of the genre while keeping in the target demographic. But most Shōnen series keep in line with the things I have described.

		<h2>Shoujo:</h2>
		<p>
			&emsp;Next is Shoujo which is kind of like the opposite of Shōnen. The word "Shoujo" in Japanese translates to "girl" (although they use a more common word when referring to girls). So it's pretty easy to guess who the genre is for; same demographic as Shōnen but for the opposite gender. The genre itself varies a tiny bit more than Shōnen though. It has a kind of sub genre known as "magical girl" which is similar to Shōnen in the way that there are over the top fights, but instead they have more of a focus on, well, magic. They also have crazy transformation sequences where the main character turns into her superhero like alter ego. That's not all Shoujo anime is though, a lot of it is drama in a slice of life type setting. The characters go through drama usually due to things like love and love triangles, especially since the cast in slice of life Shoujo consist of a lot of (handsome) men and very few women. The women are normally saved for main characters or rivals in love. So, that's Shoujo, a simple genre but one that I personally think can be more interesting than Shōnen when done right.

		<h2 class="right-align-header">Seinen:</h2>
		<p class="right-align-paragraph">
			Seinen is the last genre that is exclusive to anime and isn't really applied to animation as a whole (at least not in name). It is also the only one that I am talking about where the meaning of the word doesn't directly correlate with the genre it's used to describe. "Seinen," meaning "youth" is targeted once again men but in a different age range, this time being 18-40. This is because the genre tackles topics that apply more to adults and/or has content unsuitable for a young audience such as violence. Seinen can tackle themes such as death, obsession, loss, fear and many other things that younger people either may not have experienced yet or aren't ready to experience in fiction. It also has sub genres so a Seinen anime could be grounded in reality or take place in space and despite how I made it sound, they aren't all doom and gloom all the time. As long as there's something for an older audience it likely counts as a part of the genre.

		<h2>Slice Of Life:</h2>
		<p>
			&emsp;Finally, a genre that isn't exclusive to anime. Slice Of Life, if you didn't already know is a genre that focuses on a character or group of characters that are just going through their daily lives. Usually the genre is very character based as any story beats are normally problems that characters are facing due to other characters or life itself. The setting is also very commonly either school or work since they are universal and easy to relate to, another important aspect of the genre. Many people find the genre boring because of how simple it seems on the surface but with a good writer, you can have complex characters with interpersonal relationships with every other character. And since the genre is so grounded, it's very easy to root for a character hoping they pass a hard test or get accepted by the one they love. It's a genre that lets you peer into the world of other people.

		<h2 class="right-align-header">Comedy:</h2>
		<p class="right-align-paragraph">
			The best has been saved for last, comedy! Who doesn't need a good laugh now and then? Of course, that applies to anime too and there one great thing about anime that makes it great for comedic purposes. Anime isn't real! That means you can push what's funny to it's very limits. Want someone to fly 50 feet into the air after eating something spicy? Go ahead, do it. Unlike non-animated shows and films, it's not going to cost extra to make it happen. Nothing is impossible in animation and nothing should be impossible when it comes to humor, so they're like peanut butter and chocolate! Part of comedy is the unexpected so if one were to animate a scene in reality and then use the advantage of animation to do something crazy, it would be perfect!

		<h2>So, What Now?</h2>
		<p>
			Now you know about anime, so what? Was all of that reading pointless? A waste of time? I don't know, maybe. But, you've read this far, so there must some amount of interest. And since you now know about anime the next step is to actually watch some (other than the clips on this website of course!). "What should I watch?" Is my guess as to one of the questions on your mind, and I am here to answer that question! I have made a simple table containing anime from the 5 genres I have described as well as how an estimate at how long it would take to watch each one! I've watched most of them (or at least read their manga versions) so most of them have my stamp of approval! So pick a genre and decide how much time you want to spend and there will be one for you!
